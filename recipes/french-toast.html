    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 slices of thick bread (such as brioche or challah)</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>Butter or vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract,
        ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and a pinch of salt until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a pat of
        butter or a drizzle of vegetable oil and spread it evenly across the
        surface to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip one slice of bread into the egg mixture, allowing it to soak for a
        few seconds on each side. Be sure to coat the bread thoroughly but not
        to the point of saturation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the soaked bread slice onto the heated skillet or griddle. Repeat
        the process with the remaining bread slices, making sure not to
        overcrowd the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the French toast for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until
        golden brown and crispy. Adjust the heat if necessary to prevent
        burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooked, transfer the French toast to a serving plate and cover with
        foil to keep warm. Repeat the cooking process with the remaining slices
        of bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the French toast warm with your choice of toppings such as maple
        syrup, powdered sugar, fresh fruits, or whipped cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy your homemade French toast and savor the delightful flavors!
      </li>
    </ol>

      <strong>Note:</strong> You can also add a touch of creativity to your
      French toast by incorporating additional toppings like sliced bananas,
      berries, chopped nuts, or a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. Experiment with
      different bread types to discover your personal favorite variation.

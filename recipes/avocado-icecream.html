    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ripe avocados</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel and pit the avocados, then scoop out the flesh into a blender or
        food processor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, lime juice, and
        vanilla extract to the blender or food processor with the avocado.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the mixture on high speed until smooth and creamy, ensuring there
        are no avocado chunks remaining.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the avocado ice cream base into a lidded container and refrigerate
        for at least 2 hours to chill thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once chilled, transfer the avocado ice cream base to an ice cream maker
        and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions until it reaches
        a soft-serve consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        If desired, you can enjoy the ice cream immediately as soft-serve or
        transfer it to a lidded container and freeze for an additional 2-3 hours
        for a firmer texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the avocado ice cream in bowls or cones and garnish with your
        favorite toppings, such as crushed nuts, chocolate shavings, or a
        drizzle of honey.
